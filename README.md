# Project_sAR
Project sAR is my first iOS app to play with Augmented Reality (AR) shapes. Programmed using Swift. Currently under construction...



Currently the user can place squares and spheres anywhere in their world without a flaw. Working on adding support for more shapes and features before publishing to Apple App Store.
